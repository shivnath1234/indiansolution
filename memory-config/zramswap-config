# ZRAM Configuration for Memory Optimization
# This creates a 10 GB compressed swap in RAM with highest priority

# Enable ZRAM swap
# Set to false to disable ZRAM without uninstalling
ENABLED=true

# ZRAM size configuration
# 10G = 10 GB (adjust based on your system's RAM)
# Recommended: 25-50% of total RAM for game servers
# Examples: 4G, 8G, 10G, 16G
SIZE=10G

# Compression algorithm
# lz4    = Fastest compression, good ratio (recommended for game servers)
# lzo    = Fast compression, slightly better ratio than lz4
# zstd   = Best compression ratio, slower (good for memory-constrained systems)
# lz4hc  = Better compression than lz4, slower
ALGO=lz4

# Swap priority (0-32767, higher = used first)
# 100 = Highest priority (ZRAM used before other swap)
# This ensures ZRAM is used before zswap and traditional swap
PRIORITY=100

# Number of ZRAM devices
# 1 = Single device (recommended for most setups)
# Multiple devices can be used for parallel compression on multi-core systems
NRDEVICES=1

# Additional ZRAM parameters (advanced configuration)
# Uncomment and modify as needed

# Maximum number of pages that can be stored in ZRAM
# Leave empty for automatic calculation based on SIZE
# MAX_PAGES=

# Memory limit for ZRAM device (in bytes)
# Leave empty for no limit
# MEM_LIMIT=

# Writeback device for ZRAM (requires kernel 4.14+)
# Allows ZRAM to write cold pages to storage device
# Leave empty to disable writeback
# WRITEBACK_DEV=

# ============================================================================
# CONFIGURATION NOTES
# ============================================================================
#
# ZRAM creates compressed swap space in RAM, providing:
# - Faster swap access than disk-based swap
# - Memory compression to effectively increase available RAM
# - No disk I/O for swap operations
#
# Optimal size guidelines:
# - Systems with 8GB+ RAM: 25-50% of total RAM
# - Systems with 4-8GB RAM: 50-75% of total RAM  
# - Systems with <4GB RAM: 75-100% of total RAM
#
# Algorithm selection:
# - lz4: Best balance of speed and compression for game servers
# - zstd: Use if memory is more critical than CPU usage
# - lzo: Alternative to lz4, similar performance
#
# Priority explanation:
# - 100: ZRAM (fastest, used first)
# - 50-90: zswap cache layer (medium speed)
# - 10: Traditional disk swap (slowest, used last)
